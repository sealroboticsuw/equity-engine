  4. Employees

### Disability accommodation for employees

The University’s disability accommodation process is designed to explore
reasonable accommodations for employees (including student employees) with
medical conditions or disabilities.

#### Disability accommodation

Accommodations are provided on an individual basis and created in
collaboration with the requesting employee, the appropriate University
personnel, and the Disability Services Office. For more information about the
disability accommodation process for employees, read the UW Human Resources
disability accommodation policy.

##### Requesting disability accommodation

If you believe that a medical condition is affecting your ability to perform
your job, you may want to begin the accommodation request process by
discussing your needs with your supervisor, contacting your HR consultant or
contacting DSO. You are not required to disclose the medical need for an
accommodation to your immediate supervisor.

##### Forms for accommodation requests

During the accommodation request process, you may need to complete this form:

Accommodation Request for Disability or Serious Medical Condition (PDF)

In addition to the accommodation request form, you may be asked to submit a
health-care provider statement. Contact us if you need assistance with these
forms.

Health Care Provider Certification Form - Cognitive (PDF)  
Use this form if you are requesting accommodation based on a cognitive/mental
health condition and you do not need disability parking.

Health Care Provider Certification Form – Physical (PDF)  
Use this form if you are requesting accommodation based on a physical
disability/medical condition and you do not need disability parking.

Health Care Provider Certification Form – Parking (PDF)  
Use this form if you only need to request disability parking and/or
alternative transportation.

Health Care Provider Certification Form – Cognitive & Parking (PDF)  
Use this form if you are requesting accommodation based on a cognitive/mental
health condition and you need disability parking.

Health Care Provider Certification Form – Physical & Parking (PDF)  
Use this form if you are requesting accommodation based on a physical
disability/medical condition and you need disability parking.

Health Care Provider Certification Form - Complete (PDF)  
Use this form if there are multiple diagnoses or a combination of physical and
cognitive conditions, with or without the need for disability parking. If you
are uncertain which version of the form to use, use this complete health-care
provider statement.

  4. Manager's role

### Disability accommodation process: manager’s role

Whether you supervise faculty, staff or student employees, UW managers play an
instrumental role in the accommodation process. You are often the first person
an employee notifies that they might be in need of a disability accommodation.

While you don’t need to be an expert in accommodation, it’s essential for you
to be familiar with the University’s disability accommodation policy and know
how to respond when an employee brings a concern to your attention. Your
openness and support can make a big difference, guiding employees to the right
resources when they need them.

##### Key concept

**Reasonable Accommodation:** A modification or adjustment made to a work
environment, task or procedure that enables an employee with a temporary or
ongoing disability to perform the essential functions of their job. Changing
“the way things are usually done” in the workplace allows employees with a
disability to perform all the essential functions of the job and have an equal
opportunity to be successful.

**Taking action on employee accommodation requests or questions**

When an employee reaches out about accommodations:

  1. Listen attentively and respond with empathy to their concerns.
  2. Do not ask questions about their medical condition or disability.
  3. Share the DSO’s Disability accommodation for employees web page with them via email and copy the applicable accommodation consultant listed below.
  4. Familiarize yourself with the UW‘s disability accommodation process by watching the Manager’s role in disability accommodation on-demand training.

**Determining your designated UW accommodation consultant**

Team member’s role | Assigned UW Accommodation Consultant | How to reach them  
---|---|---  
Academic personnel | Disability Services Office (DSO) | Email dso@uw.edu or call 206-543-6450  
Medical centers staff | Your assigned med center’s leave/accommodation specialist | Select UW Medicine Human Resources – Leave Management at hr.uw.edu/contact-us/ or call 206-598-6116  
UW Facilities staff | UW Facilities HR managers | https://facilities.uw.edu/partner-resources/about/contacts  
All other staff, ASEs, student employees | Your department’s UWHR human resources consultant | Find your department on HR Contact by Organization

information, and assistance for nonmatriculated students with a documented
physical, mental, or sensory disability.

Nonmatriculated students are non-degree-seeking individuals taking courses
offered by Professional & Continuing Education, Certificate Programs,
International & English Language Programs, Online Learning, UW in the High
School and Summer Youth Programs.

Accommodations are determined for each student on an individual basis based on
input from a health-care provider. Potential accommodations include, but are
not limited to: note taking, books on tape, sign language interpreters, room
relocation, priority registration, and additional time on exams.

#### Requesting accommodation

If you are a nonmatriculated student who believes that a medical condition is
affecting your academic performance or ability to participate in University
activities, we strongly encourage you to contact us to discuss your
accommodation needs. If you are a new nonmatriculated student, schedule an
appointment well in advance of the quarter you plan to attend. If you are
currently enrolled, you can set up an appointment at any time.

During your appointment, you will discuss your needs with a Disability
Services representative to determine reasonable accommodations. Be sure to ask
what kind of health-care provider documentation you need to provide.

##### Confidentiality

It is your choice whether to disclose your disability to your instructor. To
assist you, we can prepare a letter for you to submit to your instructor
regarding your disability and your accommodation needs. We will not discuss or
disclose your medical information unless you give us written permission to do
so. When we talk with your instructor, we discuss how needed accommodations
can be implemented, not the nature of your disability.

  4. Faculty guide for Zoom classes with interpreters/captioners

### Faculty guide for Zoom classes with interpreters/captioners

Note: Updated March 30, 2020

Instructions have been provided to both the Deaf students and their
Interpreter teams in your classes.

Please know that the student/interpreter teams will be in separate concurrent
meetings, with one meeting for your class and a second meeting on a 2nd device
so that they have a dedicated Deaf Student-Interpreter connection.

This will allow the team to remain visible to each other when things like
slides or other screen shares are being presented. The interpreters and the
Deaf student will be present in both meetings.

For students getting live captioning, the captioning will happen within one
meeting, not two.

  * See other Zoom resources, and the link to log into your school account

#### Tips for Zoom classes with students who are deaf or hard of hearing

##### Please be flexible

First and most important: We all want this to be effective! We are all
learning together so we ask you to please be flexible as problems arise and
are worked out.

  * Please remember that many of us (instructors, interpreters, and students) have never experienced Zoom as a classroom platform.
  * We are a team. Your feedback is important to share so we can figure out anything that may not be working.

##### If your class is password protected

Please remember that you may have interpreters or captionists connecting to
your classes that you don’t recognize.

  * It will be important that they are able to get in to support the students who need them.
  * Please remind your students to share the password with the interpreters/captionists.

##### If your student is approved for the accommodation of CART Services or
Real-Time Captioning

The real-time captioners will be sending a link to the student who needs the
captioning and they will be able to open a separate window to receive
captioning during the class. Students are also provided with a transcript
after the class.

##### If the accommodation is “Accessible Audio/Video – Closed Captioning”

That refers to the captioning of videos (which still happens through the DRS
captioning service). Those videos are sent to drscc@us.edu for service.

##### Identify yourselves

An important consideration for the Deaf student is that they can’t look around
to see who is talking, so developing a culture of beginning a question or
comment by saying “Dimitri speaking” and **identifying themselves** is
important for the Deaf student and the interpreters or captionists to follow
the conversation.

##### Raise your hands

Use the feature in Zoom for **“raising your hand.”** This will level the
playing field and allow the Deaf person to contribute by being called on, and
allow the momentary pause necessary for the interpreter to make sure they are
unmuted to voice for the Deaf student, if they don’t voice for themselves.

##### Record class sessions

Recording serves as a good back up plan for the potential of technical
difficulties between the Deaf student and the interpreters, so that if
necessary we can go back and have something interpreted again later, or have a
transcript made for the student.

##### Manually create “Breakout rooms”

If you use the feature **“breakout rooms”** it will be important to make sure
that interpreters are sent to the same breakout as the student. Breakout rooms
can be set manually by the instructor or can be done automatically, to have
students randomly mixed up.

When you have a student using interpreters or captionists, you will need to do
breakout rooms manually to keep the providers with the student. The
Interpreters and captionists are being asked to log into the class naming
themselves “Interpreter 1” “captionists” etc.

##### Show, then Pause

If you are referring to something being shared on screen, please give a pause
so the Deaf student may turn away from their interpreter or captions and look
at what you are referring to.

Also if you are showing the students how to do something such as a different
screen with an app, leave time for the interpreter to interpret what you are
saying and the Deaf student to receive that information, before you click to
begin the process of demonstrating the app.

##### Chat, then Pause

Similarly, if you are relying on the chat feature in the classroom, the Deaf
student will not be able to follow the chat and the interpreter at the same
time. If there is something important for them to read there, it would be best
to refer to it, then pause to allow them to read it before moving on.

##### Using alternative solutions? Proactively work with us

As we have been learning zoom to make this successful for students and
interpreters, other forums such as google hangouts have not been worked out,
so if you cannot use zoom, please give us as much notice as possible, so that
we can figure out whether other considerations may be needed.

Zoom is currently the best option if interpreters or captionists are needed.
Panopto for pre-recorded lectures often will need to be re-captioned or
cleaned up for accuracy. The students will know to forward those links to have
that done.

any questions or concerns regarding ASL interpreting services or CART services
in your remote courses.

  4. Faculty guide for Zoom small group or 1:1 interpreted meetings

### Faculty guide for Zoom small group or 1:1 interpreted meetings

Note: Updated March 30, 2020

This guide is for situations where small group or one-on-one meetings happen
with interpreters, but the Deaf participant and the interpreters are within
the same zoom meeting. This would apply for small study groups, tutoring
sessions, office hours or other non-class sessions.

  * See other Zoom resources, and the link to log into your school account

#### Tips for Zoom classes with students who are deaf or hard of hearing

##### Please be flexible

First and most important: We all want this to be effective! We are all
learning together so we ask you to please be flexible as problems are worked
out.

  * Please remember that many of us (instructors, interpreters, and students) have never experienced Zoom as a classroom platform.
  * We are a team. Your feedback is important to share so we can figure out anything that may not be working.

##### Participants must be pinned

The host, the two interpreters, and the Deaf participant(s) need to “pin”
themselves to the screen. Follow these steps:

  1. Go to the three dots at the top right hand corner of your pictures.
  2. Click on “pin video” from the menu. That should keep your video on screen.
  3. Do the same with the Deaf participant(s) and the host also.
  4. The “off” interpreter will hide their video when they are not interpreting or “off.”

##### Host view (settings) = Gallery View

The host should set the “gallery view,” otherwise whoever speaks (or makes a
loud sound) their picture will take over, and everyone else will be in little
boxes.

##### Video (on) for Deaf participants and Interpreters ONLY

All other participants must turn off self-video.

  * The host should request that everyone except the Deaf participants and the interpreters turn off their video.
  * This saves bandwidth and supports Deaf participant and the interpreters seeing each other clearly.
  * There may be instances where this isn’t necessary and the decision can be made on a case by case basis, but this is an issue that needs to be considered each time.

##### Audio MUTE for everyone with exception of host and Interpreters ONLY

Everyone needs to mute, except the host and the “on” interpreter. Anyone in
the meeting can unmute themselves if they want to say something.

##### Chat feature is a wonderful tool!

The chat feature is great for people to ask questions or make a quick comment.

##### Send agenda and documents to Deaf participant and Interpreters before
session.

  * Sending the agenda and copies of any documents, especially if you plan to screen share, is essential when available.

##### Show, then Pause

If you are showing different screens for an app, and you want to show how to
do something, you must leave time for the interpreter to interpret what you
are saying, and the Deaf participants to receive that message before you click
on an icon to begin the process.

For example, “To get to the billing screen (pause…move mouse) click here
(pause a couple of seconds, then click) and you will see the ……..”

  4. Interpreter guide for Zoom classes

### Interpreter guide for Zoom classes

Note: Updated April 14, 2020

Multiple resources and YouTube videos are on the internet for step by step
instructions on how to use Zoom. Many can be found at
https://support.Zoom.us/hc/en-us. You may want to look at these if you haven’t
worked with Zoom so that you can see how to pin screens, adjust screen sizes,
etc. before interpreting in a Zoom meeting.

**If you are lacking equipment for this process, contact Dimitri. We are
collaborating with various resources on campus to loan devices where needed,
so this may be an option for you.**

#### Instruction and tips

##### Please be flexible

First and most important: We all want this to be successful! We are all
learning together so we ask you to please be flexible as the problems are
figured out.

  * Please remember that many of us (instructors, interpreters, and students) have never experienced Zoom as a classroom platform.
  * We are a team. Your feedback is important to share so we can figure out anything that may not be working.

##### Primary Device

**Classroom setup information flow:**  
**Students - > Dimitri -> Confirmation email -> Zoom Link @ “location –
class”**

  1. Students are responsible for getting all classroom and meeting links to Dimitri Azadi (dhhreq@uw.edu).
  2. Dimitri will pass them on to you.
  3. The Zoom link for the class/event will be in the “location” portion of the confirmations.

##### Secondary Device

**Interpreter setup information flow:**  
**Students - >Dimitri -> Confirmation email -> Zoom Link @ “location –
interpreting”**

  1. Interpreters will be responsible for setting up a second link for interpreter/Deaf student sessions. To support this, the UW will reimburse interpreters for a Pro Zoom account while classes remain online.
  2. This is also passed on so that for each job you will have: 
    1. A Zoom link for the primary meeting, and
    2. A Zoom link for the second meeting on a separate device for the Deaf participant and the interpreters to see each other.

##### Logging In and Identifying Yourself

For security reasons the “allow participants to change their names” feature of
the meetings cannot be turned on. One workaround to customize name before
entering a meeting is to join the meeting using the Zoom app rather than by
simply clicking a Join link from an email or browser page. This process allows
the user to enter a name prior to joining the meeting. We recommend the
following steps to log in and join the meeting with the chance to update
display name:

  * Open the Zoom desktop or mobile application and select “Sign in.”
  * Select the “SSO” option for signing in.
  * When prompted for a company domain, enter “**washington**.zoom.us” for a Standard Zoom account.
  * Enter NetID and password when prompted to complete the sign-in process.
  * Once signed in, use the “Join” button to join a meeting
  * In the pop-up, enter the Meeting ID for the given meeting and **update the Name field as desired.**
  * When ready, click **Join** to join the meeting.
  * Identify yourself as “Interpreter 1 and Interpreter 2” so that the instructor knows who you are in case they break the room into breakout discussions. They will need to keep you in the same room as your client.

##### Video settings

**Hiding a participant:** If a participant turns off their video, you may
still see a box with their name. If you do not want to see the box, go to
their picture, click on the three dots and choose “hide non-video
participants.” This will disappear people’s boxes. If they turn their video
back on, they will appear again.

**Presentation sharing and resizing:** If you have only one computer, and the
host shares a screen, which takes over a huge amount of screen space, you can
“grab” the edge between the pictures and the document, and drag the pictures
over to the left of the screen, thus narrowing the space the document
occupies, and expanding the pictures again.

##### Teaming and switching

Collaborate with your team to figure out the best way to let each other know
when to switch.

**Tip:** Depending on the size of device that you are using, in the Zoom link
for interpreting you may want to keep the Deaf client larger and the team
visible but maybe slightly smaller so that you can still see each other and
for feeding each other if necessary.

When you are the “off” interpreter, hide yourself by clicking on the three
dots, then clicking on hide video. You can also do this by clicking on the
camera icon on the bottom of your computer screen. When you become the “on”
interpreter, you turn your video back on by using the camera icon. This may
also help in turn taking.

##### Audio settings

You may also want to connect with earbuds to the class link. “Off interpreter”
should remain muted. Keep the interpreter meeting on mute to avoid auditory
distractions.

**Tip:** If you use Bluetooth, remember that batteries may run out, so a wired
headset may be the best way to go. I have been using the earbuds that came
with my phone or standard ear buds that plug into my computer.

##### Small-scale meetings or 1:1

For smaller meetings or one on one meetings, you may be asked to just connect
to the Deaf person within the same Zoom meeting. In some cases, this may work
fine if your client and you can see each other well enough.

##### Filming tips for interpreters

  * You (and your signing) will look more 3-D if you position yourself so that your body is about 45 degrees to the camera, and then you turn your head and upper body back to face the camera. “Upper body” means from about the waist up. Make it a nice, easy, gentle turn back to the camera.
  * You should be comfortable in this position. If you are not, ask yourself: “How can I sit in such a way that I look more 3-D and can sign easily?” (Don’t try to come up with an answer, your body will do that for you). **Something to experiment with.
  * To change the background to your Zoom video, on your own picture, click the 3 dots and choose change background. You can find various gray backgrounds, etc. online to upload to Zoom. This is a fun feature that may replace the need for another background, if you don’t already have one.

* * *

As backup, the DSO team recommends exchanging phone numbers with your clients
so that as a last resort you can use Facetime, or, if one of you have an
Android, you can use Google Duo (which works on both platforms) to connect
visually.

### Student guide for working with interpreters in Zoom classes

Note: Updated March 24, 2020

If you are lacking equipment for this process, contact Dimitri at
dimitri1@uw.edu.

  * We are collaborating with DRS and other resources on campus to loan devices to students where needed so this may be an option for you.
  * Other Zoom resources, and the link to log into your school account.
  * There are also help videos there (which are captioned) to understand how to use zoom.

#### Tips for working with interpreters via Zoom

##### Please be flexible

First and most important: We all want this to be successful! We are all
learning together so we ask you to please be flexible as the problems are
figured out.

  * Please remember that many of us (instructors, interpreters, and students) have never experienced Zoom as a classroom platform.
  * We are a team. Your feedback is important to share so we can figure out anything that may not be working.

##### Share your class links

It will be your responsibility to make sure we have the links for each class
or meeting. If your professor says it will be the same link every day, let us
know.

  * As your instructors send out the Zoom links to connect for your classes, share links with Dimitri Azadi (dhhreq@uw.edu).
  * He will be coordinating with the interpreters (and needs to have your links in case there is a change in schedules).

##### Share your links for smaller groups too

If you are meeting a small group separate from class for group projects or
research groups, you will want to make sure the link for those meetings are
also sent to Dimitri (dhhreq@uw.edu).

##### You create the interpreting meeting

Because the interpreters will be on a separate connection and a separate
device, you will be the one responsible for creating the interpreting meeting,
which will be joined only by you and your interpreters.

  * Send this link to Dimitri as well (dhhreq@uw.edu).
  * You may want to create an ongoing meeting for interpreting for each class, so that the link will be the same throughout the quarter. You can do this by either setting up a separate meeting for each class that is ongoing based on the schedule. Or you can use your personal meeting and just have the interpreters log into it for each meeting and class.
  * It will be helpful to log into your interpreting meeting with the interpreters 5 to 10 minutes early to ensure there are no technical issues.

##### Visibility and clarity

Please remember, that just as interpreters need to be seen clearly and with
contrasting clothing, so do you!

  * Because this is even more important through video, please think about what you are wearing, and think about what is behind you.
  * If a bright window or brightly lit room is behind you, it will be hard to see your signs.

##### Watch class on your primary device

  * On the day of the class or meeting, you will click the link to go into the Zoom meeting for your class on your preferred device.
  * Some students prefer the interpreters to be on the larger device and the class on the smaller, but it will depend on if the instructor is showing slides or other things that you also need to see.

##### Watch interpreters on your secondary device

Your interpreters should be connecting with you on this secondary device.

  * On the secondary device (the one for the interpreters) click the link to enter that meeting.
  * Remember that because you created the interpreting zoom meeting, you are the “host” and the interpreters can’t enter until you have opened that meeting.

##### Your interpreters will be on both devices

  * Your interpreters will be also on two devices. They will be connected to your class or meeting on one device and will be connected to you on the other, same as you. That way they can keep you at a size that is easy to read your signs.
  * You may want the two interpreters of equal size side by side, or you may want to move the screen to make the active interpreter larger.

##### Plan for successful interactions

Within the zoom meeting/class there are ways to “raise your hand” so that the
host of the meeting can call on you. How and when your instructors use that
feature will depend on the class. (Remember, many of the instructors are
learning how to do this at the last minute as well.) We are advising
instructors to use that feature and to give a pause between speakers.

  * If you wish to interject, or ask a question, you will probably want to figure out a way to signal the interpreter.
  * You will need to know how your interpreters will let you know it is time to switch interpreters. Because we are still experimenting with what is most effective, please communicate with your interpreters to find out how they will be taking turns.
  * We are also asking the instructors to develop a culture of everyone starting with their name so that everyone knows who is speaking.

##### Exchange contact information with interpreters

As backup, we recommend exchanging phone numbers with your interpreters so
that as a last resort you can use Facetime, or, if one of you has an Android,
you can use Google Duo (which works on both platforms) to connect visually.

### Service animals

#### **Definition of service animal**

A service animal is any dog or miniature horse that is individually trained to
perform tasks for an individual with a disability, including physical,
sensory, mental, psychological, intellectual, or other mental disabilities.
The work or tasks performed by the service animal must be directly related to
the individual’s disability. The crime deterrent effects of an animal’s
presence and the provision of emotional support, well-being, comfort, or
companionship do not constitute work or tasks.

Examples of work or tasks include, but are not limited to, assisting
individuals who are blind or have low vision with navigation or other tasks,
alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to the presence of people
or sounds, pulling a wheelchair, providing physical support and assistance
with balance and stability to individuals with mobility disabilities, and
helping persons with psychiatric and neurological disabilities by preventing
or interrupting impulsive or destructive behavior.

#### **Service animal owner’s responsibilities**

The service animal’s owner is responsible for:

  * Keeping the animal under direct control
  * Ensuring that the animal is not disruptive
  * Cleaning up after the animal immediately and disposing of waste and debris promptly
  * Dealing with any damage or injury caused by the service animal

Read the UW’s Service Animal Policy (APS 46.6) for additional responsibilities
while on University premises.

Employees needing a workplace accommodation, should visit the disability
accommodation for employees webpage.

Members of the public with service animals do not need to provide
documentation or request an accommodation.

#### **Supervisor/Building Coordinator responsibilities**

You must permit service animal access with its owner when it is readily
apparent that the animal is trained to perform tasks for the individual. If
the need is not apparent, you may ask only the following two questions of the
individual:

  * Is the service animal required because of a disability?
  * What tasks has the animal been trained to perform?

You may **not** ask for any of the following:

  * Information on the nature of the individual’s disability
  * Medical information
  * Documentation or proof that the animal is a service animal
  * Demonstration of the animal’s ability to perform tasks

If you have any doubt that the animal is required because of a disability,
admit the animal into the UW facility, and then contact the ADA coordinator.
Additionally, read the UW’s Service Animal Policy (APS 46.6) for greater
understanding of service animals on University premises.

#### **Additional resources**

APS 46.6 Service Animal Policy

APS 46.5 Policy on Reasonable Accommodation of Employees with Disabilities

### Ergonomics

Ergonomics is the practice of fitting a job to the employee so work can be
performed without harmful strain or injury. The primary goal of ergonomics is
to reduce or eliminate the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.

Most ergonomic requests can be handled through your department.

UW Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) provides guidance on ergonomics
issues. For further information, contact EH&S at 206-543-7388 or visit the
EH&S ergonomics page.

If you are experiencing pain and discomfort while performing your job duties,
contact your health-care provider. If the pain and discomfort is job-related,
report the issue to your supervisor as soon as possible, and follow the UW
accidents and injuries reporting process.

If you have a current disability or serious medical condition, submit a
disability accommodation request to the Disability Services Office.

  4. Deaf and hard of hearing service providers guidance

### Deaf and hard of hearing service providers guidance

Deaf and hard of hearing service providers are an important part of the UW
community. Coordination of DHOH services is managed by the UW’s Disability
Services Office (DSO).

#### How to become a service provider

The University relies on a pool of prequalified certified ASL interpreters and
certified real-time captioners to provide services to students, employees, and
member of the public attending University-sponsored activities at all campuses
including UW Tacoma, UW Bothell, and satellite locations and offsite events.
The first step in becoming a service provider is to review and complete the
Interpreter & Real-Time Captioning Services RFQQ (MS Word).

#### How to invoice DSO for services rendered

The contractual 30-day payment term begins when an accurate invoice is
received. Invoices must be submitted in approved format (detailed below) on a
regular and timely basis – no greater than once a week and no longer than once
a month.

Send Invoices and related communications must be sent to **DSOinv@uw.edu**.

  * Include your invoice number(s) in the subject line of your email and attach your invoice(s).
  * Service providers should submit invoices within a month of completing an assignment. Invoices received 30 days after the assignment may be subject to delay.
  * It is the sole responsibility of the service provider to submit accurate invoices. DSO **_cannot_** amend invoices in any way due to legal restrictions. Invoices requiring changes will be returned.
  * If DSO returns an invoice due to a discrepancy, the contractual 30 day payment term resets and will begin upon submission of an accurate invoice.
  * An accurate invoice will include all the information outlined in the “Invoice Completion Instructions” section below. (This information is captured in your Individualized Template provided by DSO.)

#### Invoice completion instructions

Service providers use the individually populated templates provided by DSO for
invoicing or their own invoicing software if it meets the requirements
outlined in the Functional Requirement Guidance.

  * Each invoice requires a unique invoice number generated in the Invoice Number Field. Unique invoice numbers may only be numeric values and are limited to 10 characters.
  * Each row should include the following information: 
    * **Name of client or event** (e.g. “John Smith” or “Do-It Luncheon”) – Include as much detail as possible
    * **Service description** (e.g. ASL- Psych 101a, or CART- Anthro 309)
    * **Start and end time of the assignment activity** (e.g. 8:40 AM, 10:35 AM).
    * **Check to ensure your hourly rate is correct.**
  * Retained Time: 
    * Billable time not part of the assigned activity time must be labeled and identified as “Retained time” in the Service/Description column, which must be on a _separate row from the designated assignment time._
  * Each row will include information for _only one_ segment of assigned activity or retained time. **_Note:_** One service date may include multiple assignments and/or multiple requests for retained times

**Template features**

  * Once populated with assigned activity or retained time, each row auto-calculates the total and the grand total will be updated after addition of each row.
  * Miscellaneous charges should be listed separately in the “Pre-Approved Charge” section.
  * The INVOICE TOTAL line auto-calculates to include the assigned time, retained time, and pre-approved charges.
  * Any locked portions of the individually populated template shall not be edited. DSO will edit locked portions accordingly.

> sample invoice that is not in compliance with UW’s invoicing standards:

## We did it as a team

After being accepted to the Evans Master’s Degree Program, I began to wonder
how was I ever going to get through the mounds of reading material having
recently suffering from Bell’s Palsy with left-sided dry eye syndrome from
going through cancer treatment…

Well, I somehow came across the DRS.  I believe it was in my registration or
enrollment packet.  Anyhow, I had a lot of pride and ego that held me back
from accepting that I now had a disability.  So, with a visit to the DRS
office I inquired.  The staff was SO gracious and made my visit comfortable.
I met with a staff member named Michael.  In the interview, Michael explained
the different options and resources available for me based on my disability.
“WOW!”,  I said to myself, “With these DRS services, I CAN get through this
Master’s program”!

The live readers, books on CD and the “secret” in-class note taker programs
were a great help to me.

THANK YOU! UW DRS for “rescuing” this stubborn, prideful 20-year veteran
firefighter from his academic woes!! WE DID IT as a team!

May I someday be able to pay forward what you did for me, or in some other
manner someday in my future.  If a firefighter can do it, so can you!

Blessings,  
Firefighter Mike

Disability Resources for Students (DRS) recognizes disability as an aspect of
diversity that is integral to society and to our campus community. DRS staff
work with admitted University of Washington (UW) students to ensure equal
access to UW academic programs and services. Whether transitioning from high
school, community college or another university, it’s important to be aware of
the process to request accommodations and/or auxiliary aids due to a
disability or temporary health condition.

All disability accommodations are determined through an interactive process
that requires the engagement of both the student and DRS staff.

**Students need to be aware that it could take between 1-5 weeks, sometimes
longer, to receive and implement accommodations with DRS.** This is based on a
number of potential factors, including but not limited to: the nature of a
student’s academic accommodation requests, the availability of appropriate
supporting documentation, and scheduling appointments during peak periods of a
quarter.

  * Newly admitted UW students are advised to start this process once they have confirmed admission to the UW.
  * UW students already enrolled should engage DRS as soon as possible once they have identified a barrier and/or need.

Once accommodations are established, they are applied proactively rather than
retroactively, so planning ahead is very important. The steps below provide
general information about transitioning to college, and also outline the
process for requesting and receiving disability accommodations at the UW.

## The steps for requesting accommodations through the interactive process
are:

  1. Student completes an application on myDRS, including any/all available documentation.
  2. Student is scheduled for an Access Planning Meeting (APM); student meets with DRS staff member for the APM to discuss how their disability and/or health condition presents in the relevant educational settings. Detailed information can be found on the Planning for APM page.
  3. Reasonable accommodations are determined through information presented by the student, evaluation of access barriers in environments, and DRS staff member’s professional knowledge and consultation with academic course/program staff.
  4. Notifications of approved accommodations are distributed to student. Student selects to activate accommodations in a timely manner each term. Faculty, or academic staff, are notified via the myDRS system.
  5. Students are responsible to engage in ongoing communication and interactions with assigned DRS staff as needed for activated accommodations. DRS staff facilitate necessary assistance when engaged by the student or faculty to ensure effective implementation of accommodations.

* * *

# Step 1: Apply online through MyDRS

* * *

## Complete the myDRS New Student Application.

This brief online questionnaire is for students to describe the impacts and
history of a disability and/or health condition, and request accommodations.
myDRS is the online system used by students and faculty to submit, track, and
help streamline the facilitation of accommodations and services approved for
students.

**Requesting UW On-Campus Housing Accommodations:** Students seeking
accommodations for on-campus housing must also complete a “Housing
Accommodations Questionnaire” and apply to HFS housing. For more information
on housing accommodations, please visit the DRS On-Campus Housing Page.

**Requesting Disability Parking for UW Campus** : Students seeking disability
parking access on campus will need to submit a copy of their state placard,
state ID card, or information submitted by their healthcare provider to
request a UW placard. Visit the DRS Parking page for more details.

## Submit accommodation request(s) with relevant documentation.

Documentation that establishes the nature of a disability and/or health
condition as well as its impact for the student in the educational environment
is needed to support requested accommodations. Students are encouraged to have
their healthcare providers complete the DRS Healthcare Provider Form and/or to
provide whatever documentation that they have available to support their
accommodation requests. DRS has specific documentation guidelines noted, as
well as FAQs available (see below).

Once the application and any related documentation are received, a DRS Access
Coordinator will review the application file and will communicate with the
student – either requesting additional documentation in support of the
requested accommodations, or with instructions for scheduling an Access
Planning Meeting.

* * *

# Step 2: Meet with a DRS Staff Member for your Access Planning Meeting (APM)

* * *

Upon completing the first step, a DRS staff member will follow up to schedule
an Access Planning Meeting (APM). APMs can be conducted over the phone, Zoom,
or Skype when appropriate. During this meeting, the Access Coordinator and the
student will discuss how their individual access needs impact their academic
experiences, along with any relevant educational history of using
accommodations.

Learn how to prepare for your Access Planning Meeting (APM)

* * *

# Step 3: Determination of reasonable accommodations

* * *

The purpose of the Access Planning Meeting is to engage in an interactive
process with a DRS Coordinator to discuss the submitted documentation and a
student’s experience living with a disability. The goal is to identify
appropriate accommodations and/or auxiliary aids that can be implemented to
create equal access in the areas where there are barriers caused by a
disability. Once accommodations are established, the DRS Coordinator will
share how each accommodation is activated and facilitated on a quarterly
basis.

Academic accommodations are approved on a case-by-case basis and are
individually designed to create equal access for a student. They can be
approved on a provisional, temporary, and/or permanent basis by DRS;
additional accommodations can be requested/reviewed as a student progresses
through their academic pursuits at the university.

Accommodations requests will be evaluated so they do not fundamentally alter
academic standards or modify the program/course curriculum. DRS staff will
seek feedback from academic partners with subject matter expertise when
determining if a requested accommodation will fundamentally alter a course or
program. If alternate accommodations are possible, those will be presented to
the student.

In the event that any accommodation request is not approved and the student is
in disagreement with the decision, they may seek reevaluation through the
Reconsideration Process.

* * *

# Step 4: Approved and activated accommodations are communicated with student,
appropriate faculty, and/or appropriate staff as needed.

* * *

Students are expected to:

  1. Review their DRS Student Eligibility Letter (SEL).
  2. Log into the myDRS portal and activate accommodations. Each quarter, students are responsible for making accommodations requests through myDRS in a timely manner as outlined in the Services Request Timeline. Accommodations approved and activated in the course of the quarter will have a timeline based on the date activated. 
     * Faculty notification letters are released starting 5 business days before each quarter begins.
     * Some accommodations require faculty and/or departmental consultation before they can be fully implemented. The DRS Coordinator will partner with the student and the course faculty on these specific accommodations.
  3. Communicate with each course faculty/TA/coordinator. Once faculty notification letters are released each quarter, students need to connect with each of their faculty, TA or coordinator to discuss details related to how accommodations could be facilitated in each course. Faculty, academic staff, and students can engage DRS Staff if needed to assist.

* * *

# Step 5: Ongoing communication with DRS regarding any questions or concerns.

* * *

The DRS staff is tasked with ensuring the provision of approved accommodations
and auxiliary aids. If a student experiences any difficulties in obtaining or
receiving accommodations, or if any additional accommodations are needed, the
student should follow up with their DRS Coordinator right away for assistance.

Ongoing discussions between the student and DRS staff could include:

  * Requiring assistance in the implementation of an activated accommodation
  * Reviewing the renewal process for provisional or temporary accommodations
  * Reviewing process for requesting additional accommodations
  * Discussing needs for accommodations beyond the classroom, such as: 
    * Clinicals, clerkships and internships
    * Field courses and field trips
    * Study Abroad experiences and excursions

## **Additional information on getting started with DRS**

**Privacy Information:** All information and documentation submitted to the
DRS office is kept separate from academic records and is considered private
under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). HIPAA privacy and
confidentiality guides do not apply to documents submitted to DRS, as they are
not being used for medical treatment. Under FERPA guidelines, DRS can not
guarantee complete confidentiality as there may be times when sharing some
information with other UW staff/faculty is necessary in the facilitation of
the accommodation process.

**Release of Information:** Students will need to submit an “Information
Release Consent” in myDRS if they would like their DRS Coordinator to discuss
disability accommodations with a family member, healthcare provider, or other
non-UW staff. For students not yet working with DRS, they can complete the
online Release of Information form. The DRS Healthcare Provider Form also
contains a Release of Information section for communication between DRS and
that particular healthcare provider.

**Transition Resources:** For more information on transitioning to the UW DRS
office, please visit the Transition Resources webpage.

      * Documentation Guidelines
      * College Transition Resources

## Documentation serves three purposes:

  1. To establish that the student can be considered a person with a disability, and therefore eligible for protection against discrimination on the basis of disability.
  2. To supplement information from the student regarding the impact of the disability.
  3. To inform the development of reasonable accommodation (auxiliary aids and services) designed to facilitate equal access to UW environments on a case-by-case basis.

## Documentation should include:

  * A diagnosis of the disability/health condition
  * A description of the current impact/limitations of the disability/health condition with specific focus on barriers to the educational and/or housing environment
  * A discussion of whether the disability/health condition is permanent or temporary 
    * If temporary, please provide information on the expected duration of the disability/health condition and timeline for re-evaluation.
  * Identification from a qualified healthcare provider, containing: 
    * Contact information
    * License number
    * Signature or electronic signature

### Documentation may be submitted in, but is not limited to, one of the
following formats:

  * DRS Healthcare Provider Form
  * Qualified provider’s professional letterhead
  * Official visit summary, such as emergency department discharge papers
  * Neuropsychological assessment
  * Individual Education Plan (IEP)
  * 504 Plan
  * K-12 Summaries of Performance
  * Psycho-educational evaluation (Learning Disability/ ADHD/ TBI)
  * Psychometric test results from general measures of aptitude and academic achievement (Learning Disability/ADHD/TBI)
  * Audiogram
  * Vision screening results
  * Other information from a qualified healthcare provider that can provide insight into the student’s limitations and/or provide support for any requested accommodations



### Frequently Asked Questions

Where should my documentation be submitted?

## Where should my documentation be submitted?

Students can submit documentation directly to their myDRS application, or
students or their health care providers can email it to uwdrs@uw.edu, fax it
to 206-616-8379, or drop it off in-person to DRS in Mary Gates Hall 011.

What if my existing documentation does not meet the above guidelines?

## What if my existing documentation does not meet the above guidelines?

Students are encouraged to submit what they have for review by a DRS
Coordinator. Provisional accommodations may be established while additional
documentation is being obtained. If additional documentation is needed the DRS
Coordinator can work with the student and diagnostician to clarify what
information is needed. If the student does not currently have a health care
provider that can update documentation the DRS Coordinator can help the
student identify local providers who may be of assistance.

What if I do not have any documentation for my disability and/or health
condition?

## What if I do not have any documentation for my disability and/or health
condition?

Students who do not have documentation are encouraged to schedule a meeting
with a DRS Coordinator to learn more about relevant assessments and where to
obtain them. DRS Coordinators are glad to offer advice on what assessments may
be helpful.

Where can I get documentation for a learning disability or traumatic brain
injury?

## Where can I get documentation for a learning disability or traumatic brain
injury?

When working with any diagnostician, keep in mind that the UW does have
specific requirements regarding the qualifications of diagnosticians and the
type of diagnostic testing to be done. Please refer to the DRS website for a
copy of the Documentation Guidelines for Learning Disabilities or
Documentation for a Traumatic Brain Injury prior to seeking your assessment.
We recommend that you share these guidelines with your diagnostician before
initiating the evaluation.

What is the privacy requirement for health information provided to DRS?

## What is the privacy requirement for health information provided to DRS?

All information and documentation submitted to the DRS office is kept separate
from academic records and is considered private under the Family Education
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). HIPAA privacy and confidentiality guides do
not apply to documents submitted to DRS, as they are not being used for
medical treatment. Under FERPA guidelines, DRS cannot guarantee complete
confidentiality as they may be times when sharing some information with other
UW staff/faculty with an educational need to know is necessary in the
facilitation of the accommodation process.

Housing accommodations are managed separately by each campus. Be sure to read
the DRS and housing office process for the campus you want to live on.

The types of accommodations provided are dependent on the nature of the
individual’s disability, impact within the on-campus living environment, and
provided on a case by case basis. DRS works in collaboration with the UW
Housing office to provide accommodations that meet individual student needs.

## Housing Accommodations by UW Campus:

**Seattle campus housing information (scroll below)**

**UW Bothell campus housing information**

**UW Tacoma campus housing information**

## Seattle Campus Housing Accommodations

## **Deadlines to apply for DRS Seattle housing accommodations**

**April 1st** for returning HFS students seeking a change to their Fall
quarter housing accommodations. Students ONLY need to reach out to DRS for NEW
accommodations. Otherwise, your current accommodations will automatically
transfer between quarters.

**June 1st** for newly admitted students and students who have NOT lived in
HFS on-campus housing before seeking Fall quarter housing accommodations.

**November 1st** for students seeking Winter quarter housing accommodations.

**February 1st** for students seeking Spring quarter housing accommodations.

**May 1st** for students seeking Summer quarter housing accommodations.

**Notes:** Students must follow all HFS and DRS timelines.  
Determination of housing accommodations are subject to availability.  
Applying for DRS accommodations does NOT give preference to your request.

**On-campus housing**  accommodations are determined by DRS in collaboration
with the University’s Office of Housing and Food Services (HFS) in alignment
with HFS policy. Accommodation decisions are made based on impacts within the
on-campus living environments students seek to reside in. Due to the nature of
housing assignments, requests submitted after the deadline will be processed
on a space available basis and may result in waiting until another assignment
period within the academic year.

_**NOTE- If you need Housing Accommodations for a UW-sponsored off-campus
program (study abroad, clinical placement, Friday Harbor labs, etc.), you need
to complete steps 1 & 2 below. You do NOT need to apply to HFS housing. **_

### **Step 1:    Apply to DRS**

  * Complete myDRS new student application (Use UW NetID with link above OR purple button on main DRS page) 
  * Submit documentation that verifies your disability/health condition and specifically speaks to the need for housing accommodations
    * DRS Healthcare Provider Form has a “housing assessment” section that will qualify as documentation in this case

### **Step 2:    Fill out “Housing Accommodations Questionnaire”**

  * Log in with UW NetID to access the form.
    * Helpful Hint: For new admits to the UW, make sure you confirm your acceptance and get your UW NetID before filling out this form.

### Step 3:   Apply to HFS Housing

  * Click link above to access MyHFS Portal (UW NetID login required), or visit HFS website to access portal
  * Select “disability accommodation needed” on housing profile
  * Check HFS website for housing application deadlines, which may differ from DRS housing accommodations deadlines.



## Dietary Accommodations

If you are seeking accommodations for dietary restrictions, please schedule a
consult with UW Dining Housing and Food Services (HFS) Nutrition & Systems
Manager, Jess Deer, at jtdeer@uw.edu or 206-685-3847 to explore options such
as:  

  * Discuss specific dietary needs and explore options including use of reservable kitchens that are designated allergen free such as a gluten free kitchen.
  * Learn how to access ordering options. 
  * Understand how to eat safely on campus through early access to meal plans, understanding menu board icons, and color coding of food prep areas.

Please note: Having a special dietary need does not waive the dining account
requirement for residence hall residents or give priority to be assigned to a
specific room type such as a single room or studio. If you have any further
questions, please contact HFS at 206-543-4059 or at hfsinfo@uw.edu.



## **Emotional Support Animals (ESA) and Service Animals**

### Overview

The University has a general “no pets” policy in all of its buildings,
including University Housing. However, Service Animals and Emotional Support
Animals (ESAs) can be approved as an accommodation for UW on-campus housing
through DRS.



Note- Service animals do not need to be approved by DRS to enter on-campus
buildings. They only need DRS approval for on-campus residential living.

If you are approved for an ESA or service animal by DRS, UW Housing and Food
Services (HFS) will:

  * Conduct an “animal care expectations meeting” 
  * Request verification of the following:
    * Up to date vet report including any necessary vaccination(s)
    * Acquired animal license through the City of Seattle

### Service Animals

As defined by the ADA, as well as UW APS 46.6., a service animal (dogs, and in
unique circumstances, miniature horses) has been trained to do work or perform
tasks that mitigates the impact of the person’s disability. The service animal
is an access need.

If you are requesting a Service Animal in housing be prepared to answer the
following 2 questions:

  1. _Is the animal a service animal required because of a disability?  _
  2. ___What work or tasks has the animal been trained to perform?  _

### Emotional Support Animals (ESAs)

As defined by UW APS 46.6., Emotional Support Animals (also known as therapy
animals) can include any animals (not just dogs). ESAs provide passive support
like companionship, relieving loneliness, and helping with depression,
anxiety, and certain phobias. ESAs do NOT have special training to perform
tasks that mitigate the impact of a person’s disability.  

In order for DRS to approve an ESA accommodation, you will need to provide
documentation from a qualified healthcare provider that answers the following
two questions:

  1. _Is it your recommendation that this student be approved for an ESA in the residential setting?_
  2. ___What are the symptoms the student experiences and how does the animal help mitigate those symptoms in a residential setting?_



If you are needing to request your Emotional Support Animal/Service Animal as
an employee (UW or student), you need to reach out to Disability Services
Office DSO to request this accommodation in your work environment.



## FAQ’s on Housing Accommodations

Does having a disability accommodation give me priority housing assignments?

## Does having a disability accommodation give me priority housing
assignments?

**No.** Housing applications with disability accommodations requested and
approved by the listed deadlines receive priority within each student’s
priority assignments status. This means that approved accommodation placements
will happen before others with the same priority status, but it will not
increase a priority status to a higher one for a student.

Can DRS waive termination or other HFS housing fees as disability
accommodation?

## Can DRS waive termination or other HFS housing fees as disability
accommodation?

**No**. Students should review their housing agreements before terminating
their housing agreements.

Do I need to complete more than just the housing application to receive
housing disability accommodations?

## Do I need to complete more than just the housing application to receive
housing disability accommodations?

**Yes. The process for requesting disability accommodations is separate from
the UW housing application process. Students need to apply for UW housing, and
request housing accommodations through DRS. Please review the **Steps to
Receive Housing Accommodations** , above.**

Can I apply for priority in Family Housing?

## Can I apply for priority in Family Housing?

**Yes.** The reason why family housing on campus is needed based on the
disability and or health condition will need to be stated. Students with
disabilities in family housing needs can request to be placed in 1st priority
category. The request will need to be reviewed by DRS for approval. Review the
Family Housing Priority System.

Can dependents and/or family of UW students living in family housing request
housing accommodations?

## Can dependents and/or family of UW students living in family housing
request housing accommodations?

**Yes**.  The UW student works with DRS to make the housing request for their
family members living with them. The UW student will need to complete process
outlines in the **Steps to Receive Housing Accommodations** , above.

Can I submit a request after a deadline?

## Can I submit a request after a deadline?

**Yes.** Accommodation requests will still be processed after the deadline;
however, there is a high likelihood that you will be on a waitlist, especially
if assignments have already been made for the quarter. Review the UW Housing
Accommodations Deadlines.

Is it possible to bring special furniture or my own mattress if medically
necessary?

## Is it possible to bring special furniture or my own mattress if medically
necessary?

**Yes.** With an approved accommodation, this can be arranged with advance
notice. Please review the **Steps to Receive Housing Accommodations** above.

Does having ADHD or a learning disability qualify for a single room to have a
specific study environment?

## Does having ADHD or a learning disability qualify for a single room to have
a specific study environment?

**No**. Single rooms are not assigned based on diagnosis of ADHD or learning
disability and a need for a quiet study space. HFS Residence staff can help
facilitate our agreements to allow both roommates to successfully study in
their room. In addition, study areas within residence halls, academic study
areas, and the various campus libraries are alternative places where students
can study.

What if I am diagnosed with a disability after the housing deadline?

## What if I am diagnosed with a disability after the housing deadline?

 If you are diagnosed with a disability after deadlines have passed, still
follow the steps above to receive housing accommodations. DRS will make an
effort to process your request in a timely manner, but there may be a delay in
implementation of accommodations based upon housing availability.

## How to Prepare for your Access Planning Meeting

  * Complete steps in Getting Started
  * Learn about Disability Resources for Students
  * Review students rights and responsibilities 
  * Understand what is an accommodation, what is not and how to use your accommodations
  * Explore the myDRS system and how to request your approved accommodations each quarter

## Participate in the Access Planning Meeting

The purpose of the Access Planning Meeting is to engage in an interactive
process to discuss with a DRS Coordinator submitted documentation and a
student’s experience living with a disability. The goal will be to identify
appropriate accommodations and/or auxiliary aids that can be implemented to
create equal access in the areas where there are barriers caused by a
disability. When accommodations are established, the DRS Coordinator will
share how each accommodation is requested and facilitated on a quarterly
basis.

Academic accommodations will be approved on a case by case basis and are
individually designed to create equal access for a student. They can be
approved on a provisional, temporary and/permanent basis by DRS, and
additional accommodations can be requested/reviewed as a student progresses
through their academic pursuits at the university.

## What to do after the Access Planning Meeting

**Step 1: Review your DRS Student Eligibility Letter (SEL)  
**

**Step 2: Log into myDRS portal and request approved accommodations.** Each
quarter, students are responsible for making accommodations requests through
myDRS in a timely manner as outlined in the Services Request Timeline. Here is
a link to the myDRS Student Guide for complete steps and information.

  * Faculty notification letters are released starting 5 business days before each quarter
  * Some accommodations require faculty and/or departmental consultation before than can be fully implemented. Your DRS Coordinator will partner with you and the course faculty on these specific accommodations.

**Step 3: Communicate with each course faculty/TA/coordinator.** Once faculty
notifications letters are released each quarter students need to connect with
each of their faculty, TA or coordinator to discuss details related to how
accommodations could be facilitated in each course. **  
**

**Step 4: Communicate with DRS regarding any questions or concerns.** The DRS
staff is dedicated to ensuring the provision of approved accommodations and
auxiliary aids. The UW is big campus and there may be many individuals
involved in the process of getting accommodations in place. If a student
experiences any difficulties in obtaining or receiving accommodations, or if
any additional accommodations are needed, please follow-up with their DRS
Coordinator right away for assistance.

**Step 5: Follow up with DRS Coordinator if you have any questions or concerns
as you attend courses, or for any of these additional reasons below  
**

  * Review the renewal process for provisional or temporary accommodations
  * Review process for requesting additional accommodations
  * Discuss needs for accommodations beyond the classroom, such as 
    * Clinicals, Clerkships & Internships
    * Field courses & Field trips
    * Study Abroad experiences & excursions

## **Additional information on working with DRS**

**Privacy:** All information documentation submitted to the DRS office is kept
separate from an academic record and is considered private under the Family
Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). DRS can not guarantee
confidentiality as they may be times when sharing some information in
necessary in the facilitation of the accommodation process.

**Release of Information:** Students will need to submit an “Information
Release Consent” in myDRS if they would like their DRS Coordinator to discuss
disability accommodations with a family member, healthcare provider, or other
non UW staff. This can also be completed in myDRS, click here for the myDRS
Student Guide. For students not yet working with DRS you can complete the
online Release of Information.

Going to college can be a significant transition for both student and family.
For many students this is the first time they are separating from family and
moving toward independence. This is an exciting time but the transition can
also bring up concerns for all involved. Students with disabilities and their
families must also understand what it means to transition to a university with
a disability and what steps to take in order to receive support from
Disability Resources for Students (DRS) at UW.

While DRS cannot promise your student will succeed, we are committed to
ensuring that your student has equal access to all UW programs and services,
and facilitating opportunities for success. Below are resources that will be
helpful in facilitating a smooth transition to higher education. DRS is
excited to be a partner with students during their journey at the UW.

## Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA)

Because of The Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA), your experience
as a parent or guardian will be different from the K-12 system. At the high
school level, the relationship was between the school district and the
parents; at the college level, the relationship is between the college and the
student. Once your son or daughter enrolls in a post-secondary institution,
whether they are 18 years old or not, they become the sole guardian of all
records maintained by that institution.

Your student may choose to fill out the DRS Release of Information form so
that you may be included in your student’s affiliation with Disability
Resources for Students. The release of information form may also be used to
request documentation to be sent to DRS from your student’s physician or
previous school.

## Individual Education Plans (IEPs) and 504 plans

Individual Education Plans (IEPs) and 504 plans often differ significantly
from the accommodations and services provided at the post-secondary level. One
difference is that IEPs and 504 plans do not always contain the
evaluation/assessment scores that qualify a student with a learning disability
for accommodations and services at the higher education level. If
evaluation/assessment scores are not available or your student needs to be
assessed for a disability, please contact us to discuss your options.

The second difference is the role of the school in the provision of
accommodations. At the high school level, the school is responsible for
identifying students who need accommodations or services. However, in higher
education students are responsible for identifying themselves to the
disability office and state their requested accommodations. Once
accommodations are approved DRS partners with your student and their faculty
to ensure effective and appropriate accommodations are facilitated to provide
equal access.

## Using Approved Accommodations

Once a student has been approved for accommodations by their DRS Coordinator,
they will receive a Student Eligibility Letter via our myDRS system along with
necessary next steps. Students then use the myDRS system to select which
approved accommodations they want to activate in a course, each quarter.
Through myDRS a Faculty Notification Letter is delivered to course faculty and
relevant academic staff. Quarterly course activations need to be done in a
timely manner for accommodations can not be submitted retroactively.

  * Student: Quarterly Services Activation Timeline
  * Faculty: Notification Letter Response Timeline

Once faculty have been notified, students need to meet with them to discuss
the details of how each accommodation will/can work in course. In some
circumstances, requested accommodations may not be reasonable in specific
courses. If this arises, Faculty will need to engage with DRS to determine
what is reasonable. In cases where, based on the nature of the course, a
requested accommodation is not reasonable DRS may explore alternatives if an
access barrier is still present.

## Requesting Additional Accommodations

Accommodations are approved initially by DRS staff in the Access Planning
Meeting based on the needs and access barriers the student is encountering at
that time. However, DRS recognizes that needs and barriers can change and/or
evolve as a student progresses through an academic program. If a student
encounters new barriers, emergent needs, or seeks to modify a current
accommodation, they can request additional accommodations through myDRS by
completing the “Additional Accommodation Request Form” and submitting it
online. A DRS Coordinator will follow up to reengage the interactive process
and resolve the additional access need request.

To request a new accommodation or a revision to your current accommodations,
follow the instructions below:

1\. Go to our website, disability.uw.edu  
2\. Click on the YELLOW box that says myDRS  
3\. Log in with your UW NetID and password  
4\. Click on “Additional Accommodation Request Form” on left side under ‘Home’  
5\. Submit your request there.

Your Access Coordinator will review the request within 48 (business) hours and
reach out to you if they need any more information.

Please don’t hesitate to let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

In the event that your accommodation request is not approved and you are in
disagreement with the decision, you may seek reevaluation through the Student
Reconsideration Process.

## Requests of Significant Course/Program Modifications

Occasionally, DRS receives an accommodation request that may result in a
fundamental alteration to the nature of a course or operation of the
institution, program, course, service, or activity. However, each request is
evaluated in alignment with the UW Student Accommodation policy. Due to the
case-by-case nature of the accommodation request process any determination of
what is reasonable or not will include, but not be limited to: fact-specific
information about participation and evaluation requirements, individualized
analysis of the disabled student’s circumstances, and a review of effective
alternatives that would meet the program’s standards.

Due to the highly individualized circumstances for each case DRS must consult
with relevant academic personnel in the evaluation of: each accommodation
request, understanding the impact to course outcomes and/or program
requirements, and assessment into the availability of alternatives. Mere
speculation about reasonableness/unreasonableness falls short of this
requirement.

*All accommodation requests are evaluated by DRS for students with disabilities or health conditions only.

## Accommodations Not Provided in Higher Education

Disability Resources for Students works to ensure access for students with
disabilities by designing and implementing accommodations. However, there are
some items that are not accommodations in higher education; this includes, but
is not limited to:

  * Individualized instruction
  * Tutoring
  * Personal care attendant provided by institution
  * Provision of Personal Aids and Assistive Devices (i.e. wheelchairs, hearing aids, etc.)
  * Transportation to/from campus

In order to ensure sufficient time to make provisions for appropriate
accommodations and auxiliary aid(s), students must request to activate
accommodations in a timely manner. Below is a list of services and appropriate
timelines for most circumstances. If a request is submitted after the relevant
deadline, DRS will make every reasonable effort to activate but completed
timeline may be adjusted based on submission date. Accommodations can be
approved and activated throughout the quarter, but are not retroactive.
Untimely requests may result in delay, substitutions, or the inability to
fulfill the request(s).

**Type of Service** | **Time Required**  
---|---  
**Accessible Instructional Materials** | Requests for _non-STEM text-to-speech conversion_ and _image file conversion_ (from photocopies/scans) are due **at least 4 weeks** prior to the 1st day of class. Requests for _all other_ accessible instructional materials are due **at least 5 weeks** prior to the 1st day of class.  
**Classroom Services:  **Classroom Relocation, Furniture Requests (tables, chairs, podiums), Lab Assistants, Readers, Scribes | Requests for classroom services are due at least 4 weeks prior to the 1st day of class.  
**Communication Access:   **Real Time Captioning, ASL Interpreter, Video Captioning | Requests for communication access services are made through myDRS. Recurring classroom and multi-day event requests are due at least 5 weeks in advance. Requests for one-time events and meetings are due at least 10 days in advance.  
****Clinicals, Clerkships, Practicums, Externships, Internships, etc.**  ** | Accommodations relevant for non-classroom activities should be discussed as soon as possible with your DRS Coordinator. The process to evaluate, design and implement accommodations in these settings need to be done well in advance of the start of the fieldwork and preferably before locations are assigned, since accommodations at these sites can involve a multi-department effort.  
**Disability-Related Absences Agreement** | Complete a Disability-Related Absences Agreement for each class, with your professor, before the end of the 2nd week of the classes.  
**Exam Accommodations**** ** | Review the Alternative Testing Agreement submitted by your professor in your myDRS profile. Exams can not be schedule until this agreement is in place.  Exam request deadlines:

  * Midterms & quizzes: 5 business days
  * Finals: 10 business days

Review steps and responsibilities in more detail on the DRS Student Testing
Center webpage.  
**Foreign Language Requirement Substitution** | Foreign language substitutions should be requested as soon as possible for multiple departments work together on process. There must be sufficient time to process the request. Further documentation may be required and coordination must occur with the departments and the student’s advisor. This can take up to three quarters to be finalized depending on the complication of each individual student case.  
**Hardship Withdrawal Petition; Tuition Forfeiture Petition** | Hardship withdrawal petitions are due within 1 academic year of the quarter being appealed. Other deadlines regarding tuition, etc. may apply. Please visit the UW Registrar Hardship Withdrawal page for more information.  
**Housing Accommodations** | Requests for housing accommodations are due at least 3 months prior to the anticipated move-in date. Please visit the DRS Housing webpage for more information.

Students have the right to seek accommodation reconsideration upon a denial of
a requested accommodation. Below are the steps to engage in the
reconsideration process. This process is aligned to UW Policy: Reasonable
Accommodation of Students with Disabilities (SGP Chapter 208)

## Step 1

  * Access Coordinator (Seattle) or Associate Directors (Bothell/Tacoma) send formal “Denial of Requested Accommodation” email to student with the outline of stated reasons for denial and alternatives discussed, but not accepted by the student, along with information about the DRS accommodation reconsideration process.
  * Student has 10 business days, upon receiving the notice, to submit a reconsideration request to the DRS Tri Campus team (or designee) for review. The Tri Campus Team has discretion to modify the 10-day requirement as needed to gather necessary information from the student. 
    * Tri Campus team consists of: DRS Directors (or designees) from each campus
  * The student should include their specific grounds for reconsideration, with a full explanation and any supporting documentation that may explain the barrier to access. Questions to address include: 
    * What is/are the accommodation request(s) that you are seeking to have reconsidered?
    * What barrier(s) and/or impact(s) are you having in the environment based on your disability /health condition?
    * Have you received additional healthcare documentation that supports the barrier(s) and/or impact occurring?
  * The reconsideration request must be submitted using this online submission form (sign in with UW e-mail ONLY): DRS Reconsideration Submission

## Step 2

  * DRS Tri Campus team, or stated designees, has 15 business days upon receipt of the reconsideration request to make a final determination. They will review all relevant DRS information and engage with the student to discuss the request. The DRS Tri Campus Team has discretion to modify the 15-day requirement as needed to gather necessary information from student and/or process the reconsideration request completely.
  * If student does not agree with the DRS Tri Campus Team final determination, the student has 10 business days to request a file review by the campus specific DRS Administrator (i.e. Assistant Dean or Associate Vice President) and University ADA/Section 504 Coordinator.

## Step 3

  * DRS Campus Administrator and University ADA/Section 504 Coordinator (or stated designees) have 15 business days once the request is received to review the file, and make a final determination. 
  * If student is not in agreement with final DRS Campus Administrator and University ADA/Section 504 Coordinator determination, they are referred to UCIRO to pursue the university’s grievance process.

course syllabi:

## Access and Accommodations:

Your experience in this class is important to me. It is the policy and
practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible
learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you have
already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students
(DRS), please activate your accommodations via myDRS so we can discuss how
they will be implemented in this course.

If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary
health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations
(conditions include but not limited to; mental health, attention-related,
learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), contact DRS directly
to set up an Access Plan. DRS facilitates the interactive process that
establishes reasonable accommodations. Contact DRS at disability.uw.edu.

## Overview

For nearly 40 years Disability Resources for Students (DRS) has been dedicated
to ensuring access and inclusion for students with disabilities on the Seattle
campus. This includes matriculated students in undergraduate, graduate,
professional, Evening Degree, and Access programs. DRS serves over 2,400
students with temporary and permanent physical, health, learning, sensory, or
psychological disabilities. DRS partners with students to establish services
for their access and inclusion on campus.

The University of Washington (UW) strives to create a community of access and
inclusion on campus. More students with disabilities and/or health conditions
are working with DRS. However, many students first disclose their disability
to a faculty/staff member before establishing services with DRS. Below are
some ways to help connect students with disabilities and/or health conditions
to our office.

## Making a Referral to Disability Resources for Students (DRS)

DRS works with students who have disabilities and/or health conditions that
effect a wide range of major life activities. In addition to serving students
with physical and sensory disabilities, DRS works with students who have:

  * Psychological diagnoses such as Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar, or PTSD
  * Learning disabilities such as ADHD or Dyslexia
  * Chronic health conditions such as HIV, cancer, traumatic brain injuries, food allergies or diabetes

While this is not an exhaustive list, it does represent common reasons that
students work with DRS.  It is not uncommon for students to be unaware of DRS
as many students did not engage with resources in K-12.  Faculty or staff are
often the first people who students share health conditions and/or struggles
related to disabilities in interactions. Below are some resources on how to
refer a student to DRS to see if we can be of assistance and support for them.

**If you have questions about whether DRS is and appropriate resource please
contact our main office anything or review ourMeet the Staff page for academic
college liaisons connections available to you directly.**

### When a referral to DRS needs to happen

  * If a student directly discloses a disability, health condition, and or pregnancy to you 
    * Example: a student shares with you that they are depressed and on medication
  * Students discloses receiving past accommodations or services, either as a transfer student or in K-12 
    * Example: a student shares they previously had extra time on an exam in another course or school and want to use them here

### When a referral to DRS could happen

  * If you see a student who is struggling, you engage with them directly and share campus resources available to them

### Ways to document a referral to DRS

  * **Email template idea to share with a student who directly self discloses a disability or health condition to you is below**. You are welcome to copy and paste, with necessary edits related to your situation, while cc’ing uwdrs@uw.edu so we can follow with an outreach directly. If a student shares information with you about a disability, making this direct referral is not a violation of confidentiality; rather, you’re giving them the resource who can best help them explore options: 
    * Hello Student- Thank you for our conversation yesterday it was great to learn more about you and discuss aspects of the class. I wanted to follow up with information about an office on campus who you can connect with to discuss resources that could be helpful in your academic pursuits. 
      * Disability Resources for Students (DRS) works with a wide range of disabilities and health conditions either on a temporary or permanent basis. Their focus is to ensure access for students. You can learn more about them in a variety of ways: visit daily drop in hours (view website for details), view the DRS website and “Getting Started” information and or scheduling a personal consultation meeting if you want to talk in detail about questions you have. They will be reaching out to you as well, as I have included them on the email, in case you want to get any more information. Thank you.
  * **Email if a student is referred to campus resources.** You are welcome to copy and paste, with necessary edits related to your situation, while cc’ing uwdrs@uw.edu so we can follow with an outreach directly. 
    * Hello Student- Thank you for our conversation yesterday it was great to learn more about you and discuss aspects of the class. I wanted to follow up with information about a few offices on campus that you may want to connect in support of  your academic pursuits. 
      * Disability Resources for Students (DRS) works will a wide range of disabilities and health conditions either on a temporary or permanent basis. Their focus is to ensure access for students. You can learn more about them in a variety of ways: visit daily drop in hours (view website for details), view the DRS website and “Getting Started” information and or scheduling a personal consultation meeting if you want to talk in detail about questions you have. They will be reaching out to you as well, as I have included them on the email, in case you want to get any more information. Thank you. 
        * NOTE: Add additional offices you are suggesting to the student, including the new Husky Health & Well-Being website.

### Students right to self disclosure & confidentiality

Remember that our students are adults; they may respond best to private
conversations in which you use an inquiring and supportive approach and share
information about the existence and location of the DRS office. Only the
student can decide to disclose their disability, or to pursue information
about services available in the DRS office. Therefore, it is essential that
disability information be kept confidential as it falls under FERPA.  Again,
making the direct referral to DRS is not a violation of the student’s
confidentiality but at no time should the class or other students be informed
that a student has a disability, except at the student’s request. All
information that a student shares with a faculty member is to be used
specifically for arranging reasonable accommodations for the course of study.

### What is the privacy requirement for health information provided to DRS?

All information and documentation submitted to the DRS office is kept separate
from an academic record and is considered private under the Family Education
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). HIPPA privacy and confidentiality guides do
not apply to documents submitted to DRS for they are not being used for
treatment. Under FERPA guidelines DRS cannot guarantee complete
confidentiality as there may be times when sharing some information with other
UW staff/faculty is necessary on an educational need to know basis (i.e.
facilitation of the accommodation process).

## Additional resources in creating inclusive classrooms or programs

### DRS Syllabus Statement

Many faculty have found it highly effective and helpful to include a syllabus
a statement asking students to inform them of any access or accommodation
needs while in the course. For students this can also serve as a way to
demonstrate that you are sensitive and concerned about meeting the needs of
ALL students you teach. Lastly, it affords students the opportunity to make
their accommodation needs known to you early in the quarter.

### Creating Inclusive Instructional Materials (i.e. textbooks, course-packs,
video, websites)

Education is becoming more infused with technology than ever before. While
this has tremendous benefits for educational delivery we still have to ensure
that we are collectively creating an inclusive educational environment for
students. Below are some resources to consider as you design, plan and update
courses and programs with more advanced levels of accessibility always an
option through consultation with DRS.

  * Do you use Canvas, Blackboard, Catalyst or another Learning Management System? Following DRS’s Online Course Accessibility Checklist is a basic strategy to ensure online course content is accessible and check out this 30 min video about Canvas’s perspective on accessibility
  * Want to hear what other faculty have done? Check out these articles: Online Accessibility a Faculty Duty and Views of a Faculty Member: Accessibility From Where I Stand.
  * Courses at the University of Washington need to be accessible to all student, why you ask: Why technology and materials need to be accessible 
  * How to make accessible word documents, PDFs, and videos please refer to the UW Accessibility webpage but for quick basic conversions check out the Free Online Document Conversion Tool.

### Receiving a Request for Approved Accommodations

Formal requests for accommodations will come to you in a Faculty Notification
Letter (FNL) via the myDRS online system. The accommodations in these letters
are not meant to give students with disabilities an unfair advantage, but
rather to give them an equal opportunity to demonstrate mastery of course
content. Although a student may request an academic adjustment at any time,
the student should request this as early as possible. Some academic
adjustments may take more time to provide than others. The student should
follow established procedures to ensure that the University has enough time to
review the request and provide an appropriate academic adjustment.

Also, DRS does not ask that instructors modify essential course requirements
for the sake of the student. Any faculty member considering denying an
accommodation because it modifies an essential course requirement should
consult with DRS; the responsibility and authority for determining appropriate
and reasonable accommodations lies with DRS.  If you have any questions or
concerns regarding the FNL or an accommodation, please contact the student’s
coordinator. You can review our Meet the Staff page for DRS academic college
liaisons.

The Disability Resources for Students serves the faculty and students equally.
Once students are admitted to UW, DRS works with them to facilitate their
requests and approve services.

Students with a wide array of physical, sensory, cognitive and mental health
disabilities attend the University and are active in all majors and
disciplines at every level of the educational system; undergraduate, graduate
and professional programs. DRS partners with the student, faculty and
appropriate campus departments to establish the accommodations needed to
remove the student’s unique access barrier(s).

The University provides reasonable accommodation to the known physical or
mental limitations of qualified disabled students so long as doing so does not
impose an undue hardship on the University or fundamentally alter the
educational program. Reasonable accommodations may include providing
appropriate core services necessary to ensure equal access, such as early
registration or providing materials in alternative formats.

When academic accommodations are needed, they are determined for each student
on an individual basis by DRS staff and designed through the interactive
process with a student. The interactive process includes: documentation of a
disability; student DRS application; DRS Access Planning Meeting; and any
follow up needed to ensure reasonable accommodations have been considered.

## Faculty Responsibilities

Faculty, and relevant academic staff, are primarily responsible in providing
activated accommodations communicated in the DRS Faculty Notification Letter
(FNL) in a timely manner. Other responsibilities include:  
• Provide only the accommodations communicated in the FNL unless it is an
accommodation that they willing to offer all students in the class.  
• Contact DRS if there are questions or concerns about requested adjustments
and/or for assistance in identifying the best method for providing
accommodations for students enrolled in classes.  
• In the event that a significant concerns arises about an activated
accommodation impacting the nature of a course pursue a reevaluation through
the Faculty Reconsideration Process (see Section III. Reconsideration
Process).  
• Refer any student to DRS who is requesting adjustments but does not present
a DRS FNL.  
• Ensure instructional materials are accessible. DRS can collaborate with
faculty to ensure access. This may include: video captioning, transcripts of
audio lectures/podcasts, and accessible materials (i.e. course packs, lecture
exhibits).  
• Maintain accommodation information under FERPA. Faculty should not ask
students about the nature of their disability or to provide medical
documentation nor share information with the class.  
• Implement best practices in teaching to reach a diversity of learners.

## DRS Services to Faculty

The Disability Resources for Students serves the faculty and students equally.
We assist students once they are admitted to UW, facilitate their requests and
approve services. For faculty we are your resource and collaborator in
ensuring the academic accommodations are in place and effective. If you as
faculty have questions, problems establishing an accommodation, or need help
on where to start DRS is here for you. We provide a variety of services for
faculty delivering instruction, including by not limited to:

  * Troubleshooting/assisting with establishing classroom accommodations
  * Facilitation of extended time and low-stimuli testing environments
  * Providing consultation on working with various types of disabilities
  * Assisting faculty in ensuring they have accessible course materials
  * Providing faculty training and educational resources

## Confidentiality

It is an individual’s choice whether to disclose the nature of his/her
disability to faculty. Asking a student for more details regarding their
disability is not permitted as the confidentiality of medical information must
be maintained. DRS can and will discuss student information with faculty
related to the facilitation of accommodations.

Below are frequently asked questions of Disability Resources for Students
(DRS). There are general questions that are asked of multiple audiences
(students, staff, faculty, families, administrators, etc…). We also identified
some questions applicable to specific audiences.

### General DRS FAQs

What is a disability?

## What is a disability?

According to the Americans with Disabilities Act and Washington State Law, a
disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or
more major life activities. Major life activities related to education
include, but are not limited to: walking, sleeping, eating, learning, reading,
writing, processing, hearing, etc.

**Tip:**  For more information, please refer to DRS’s Law & Policy page.
Questions are welcomed; you can call or email the DRS front desk or contact a
student’s DRS Coordinator directly.

What is an accommodation?

## What is an accommodation?

An accommodation is an adjustment made to a policy and/or academic environment
to ensure students with temporary or permanent disabilities have equal access
to course material, information, activities, programs, housing, and other
campus facilities.

**Tip:**  For more information, please refer to the DRS Accommodations page.

How does a student get started with DRS?

## How does a student get started with DRS?

First, a student must complete the DRS new student application and submit
documentation from a qualified healthcare professional. Then, DRS engages the
student in the interactive process to determine reasonable accommodations.

For more information, please refer to the DRS Getting Started page.

Does a student need to provide medical documentation to be approved for
accommodations?

## Does a student need to provide medical documentation to be approved for
accommodations?

The University of Washington (UW) requires students seeking services to
provide documentation from a qualified healthcare professional that describes
the disability/health condition as well as shares the functional impact on the
student’s academic experiences. DRS has specific documentation guidelines to
provide an outline of the information necessary to establish that a student
has a disability and/or temporary health condition.

For more detailed information about required documentation, including
guidelines for specific conditions, please refer to the Documentation
Guidelines outlined on our website.

Does DRS adhere to any privacy laws?

## Does DRS adhere to any privacy laws?

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 (20 U.S.C. §
1232g; 34 CFR Part 99) is a federal law that protects the privacy of student
education records. All information and documentation submitted to the DRS
office is kept separate from an academic record and is considered private
under FERPA. It is an individual’s choice whether to disclose the nature of
their disability to faculty. Asking a student for more details regarding their
disability is not permitted as the confidentiality of medical information must
be maintained. DRS can and will discuss student information with Faculty
related to the facilitation of accommodations.

**Resources:  **Some resources about FERPA are found at Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) for Students and FERPA Training for Staff &
Faculty. For more information about confidentiality for faculty and staff,
please visit the Faculty Responsibilities page. Students may also authorize
DRS to release information about their disability accommodations with a family
member, healthcare provider, or other non UW staff. The student would need to
complete the Release of Information Form.

What is a service animal?

## What is a service animal?

A service animal is an animal that is trained to work or perform active tasks
for an individual with a disability. If it is unclear whether an animal is a
service animal, anyone can ask following questions: (1) is the service animal
required because of a disability? and (2) what work or task the animal has
been trained to perform? If you are unsure whether these questions have been
answered satisfactorily, allow the person and animal to proceed, and contact
DRS.

**Resource:**  For UW-specific information, visit the University of Washington
Service Animals page. For more general information, visit U.S. Department of
Justice Frequently Asked Questions about Service Animals and the ADA.

What is academic coaching?

## What is academic coaching?

Coaching focuses on addressing impacts to executive functioning for DRS
students. Working one-on-one with an academic coach will help students
identify and utilize new learning tools and strategies in order to help
students meet their academic and personal goals. Students and coach develop
working relationships through meetings and follow up email communications. In
the meetings, coaches use a variety of tools to help students improve their
time management, study strategies, issues related to attention, focus, and
motivation.

What is the social model of disability?

## What is the social model of disability?

Watch this 3 min YouTube video for a short explanation about social model of
disability.

What laws protect the rights of students with disabilities?

## What laws protect the rights of students with disabilities?

_Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973_ requires recipients of federal
funding to afford individuals with disabilities equal access to all services.
In 1990, the _Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)_ spelled out in greater
detail the obligations not only of recipients of federal funds but also
private businesses and public spaces. Details like door sizes, toilet and grab
bar heights, parking spaces, and many others were clearly defined. In 2008,
after a series of court decisions eroded congress’s intent with the ADA,
Congress passed the amendments act. The _ADA Amendments Act_ reaffirms
congress’s intention that the ADA applies to individuals with all types of
disabilities including those suffering from long-term illnesses such as cancer
or impairments to bodily systems and made clear that mitigating measures
should not be taken into effect when determining whether an individual has a
disability. The intent and effect of the amendments act was to significantly
expand the number of people covered by the ADA.

Law & Policy page.

While each student is unique, start from a “people-first” perspective. Below
is a link to some general themes of how to engage with students.

**Tip:** Check out our website on tips for working with different
disabilities.

What is my legal obligation?

## What is my legal obligation?

Relevant academic faculty and staff will be asked to implement approved
accommodations and maintain student’s confidentiality. DRS will send the
Faculty Notification Letter for more information about an individual student.
Contact DRS if you are not sure what you need to do.

**Resources:  **Some resources about FERPA are found at Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) for Students and FERPA Training for Staff &
Faculty. For more information about law and UW policy, refer to the DRS Law &
Policy page.

My department is purchasing a new software program or piece of equipment. How
can I make sure it’s accessible to students with disabilities?

## My department is purchasing a new software program or piece of equipment.
How can I make sure it’s accessible to students with disabilities?

The UW is responsible for making all of its programs and facilities accessible
to people with disabilities.  Purchasing accessible products helps the
university meet this responsibility. Vendors should be able to provide
accessibility information about the products they sell, so be sure to ask.
More information about procuring accessible products can be found on the UW
Accessibility webpage.

**Tip** :  Make accessibility audits a mandatory part of your department’s
procurement process.

My department has technical standards for a profession. How can I make sure
these are not discriminatory?

## My department has technical standards for a profession. How can I make sure
these are not discriminatory?

Technical standards are meant to identify learning outcomes critical for a
given program.  These should be regularly reviewed by faculty to ensure they
are representative of the current demands in a given field. The ADA
regulations state: “[schools] shall not impose or apply eligibility criteria
that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or any
class of individuals with disabilities…unless such criteria can be shown to be
necessary for the provision of the service, program, or activity being
offered. (28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(8); 28 C.F.R. 36.301(a).)  This means that a
school’s technical standards must focus on the skill required, not on
characteristics of a student.

**Tip** : Review technical standards for common pitfalls, such as
unnecessarily associating a task with a specific sense.  For example, students
in a nursing program may be required to detect a heartbeat, but it’s not
necessary to hear a heartbeat.

Are there more students with disabilities in college now than ever before?

## Are there more students with disabilities in college now than ever before?

Yes. Accessible technologies, advances in healthcare, better resources in
K-12, broadening of the term disability under the ADA Amendments Act, and a
social model of disability have all contributed to both the reduction in
stigma of a disability as well as the creation of or more opportunities for
students with disabilities in higher education.

Faculty have the right to object to a Disability Resources for Students (DRS)
approved academic adjustment or auxiliary aid in their program or classroom if
they have concerns about the impact to the educational delivery or outcome of
the course. Below are the steps to engage in a process to raise the concern
for discussion and review. In all cases the approved accommodation will need
to be active and implemented during the dispute resolution process until an
alternative decision, if any, is made to modify or alter it. This process is
aligned to UW Policy: Reasonable Accommodation of Students with Disabilities
(SGP Chapter 208)

## Step 1

  * Upon receipt of a DRS Faculty Notification Letter (FNL), with stated approved accommodations, faculty need to immediately engage with the listed DRS Access Coordinator to seek a consultation regarding the specific concerns.
  * DRS Staff and course Faculty will engage in a review of the accommodation and the perceived impacts of implementation in the course/program. DRS will review student file and approval process to attempt to resolve/address faculty concerns as soon as possible. 
  * If needed, DRS staff will engage in the fundamental alteration process to review concerns per the relevant decision making framework and engage as necessary the faculty/academic department. DRS will share outcomes and decision of process with course/program Faculty.

## Step 2

  * If Faculty disagrees with DRS final determination in Step 1, they will have 10 business days from receiving any notice to submit their concerns and dispute to identified administrators in Compliance Services and Academic Student Affairs (e.g., ADA/Section 504 Coordinator and Vice Provost for Academic and Student Affairs) for appeal.
  * The identified administrators, or stated designee(s), will have 15 business days once the case is received to engage with faculty, DRS, student, and work out a final determination.
  * If agreement cannot be reached at the end of an Compliance Services/Academic Student Affairs review:
    * Student will be notified of right to file a grievance or compliant via UW UCIRO and/or OCR.
    * The identified administrators, or stated designee(s), will advise the next level of administration of the impasse.

# Overview

* * *

**Alternative Testing** is a group of academic accommodations approved by
Disability Resources for Students (DRS) to provide access to course
examinations, tests and quizzes for students whose documented disability
affects their ability to take exams.

Alternative Testing accommodations can be facilitated by the faculty member,
academic department, or through the DRS Testing Center. The DRS Testing Center
is located in or near the DRS office (although classrooms in other locations
may be utilized during busy testing seasons). Students may discuss their
preferred testing location with their professors.

Faculty make the final decisions about whether an exam will be accommodated
within the department, or in DRS during business hours. If faculty choose to
facilitate accommodated exams themselves or within the department, they will
consult with DRS Staff and/or engage the DRS Proctoring Services.

# 3 Most Common Testing Accommodations

* * *

The following are descriptions and examples of the most common DRS testing
accommodations as shared for information with faculty and academic staff in
consultation with the DRS Testing Center staff regarding successful
facilitation of accommodated exams outside of DRS.

## 1\. Reduced Distraction Environment

A reduced distraction environment means that the student needs to take the
exam in an area that is reasonably quiet with low stimuli, when compared to
the classroom. The environment doesn’t need to be a silent private setting.
The environment can include taking the test with other students and the room
chosen must allow for students to start and finish their exams with limited
interruptions. Tools that may help further reduce distractions for students
may include: noise cancelling headsets, ear plugs, study carrels, etc.

Examples:

  * Reasonable locations include: a reserved conference room, office, or lounge with a door 
  * Unreasonable locations: a hallway, or a room that people frequent and can’t be reserved.
  * Distractions that need to be avoided include, but are not limited to: ringing telephones, conversations, rustling of chairs/papers, coughing, excessive movement, typing, traffic, etc.

## 2\. Private Room

A private room accommodation means that the student needs to take an exam in a
reasonably quiet with low stimuli room on their own. A TA or professor can be
in the room to proctor a test/quiz. However, the proctor must be mindful of
creating distractions.

Examples:

  * Reasonable locations include: a reserved conference room, office, or lounge with a door (with no other students/unnecessary persons around)
  * Unreasonable locations: a hallway, or a room that people frequent and can’t be reserved.
  * Distractions that need to be avoided include, but are not limited to: ringing telephones, conversations, rustling of chairs/papers, coughing, excessive movement, typing, traffic, etc.

## 3\. Extra Time on Tests/Quizzes

Students who have the accommodation of extra time on tests/quizzes should
receive extra time on any test/quiz intended to be completed in a single
session and is graded such as; quizzes, pop quizzes, exams, midterms and
finals. The additional time is calculated from the total amount of time given
to the class to take the test/quiz.

  * **Extra time for online exams:** If an exam is to be completed through an online learning management system, extra time can be added for an individual student. Instructors/faculty should contact UW IT at: http://itconnect.uw.edu/ for more information.
  * **Extra time for take-home exams:** A take-home exam is an exam to be completed outside of the classroom over a period of multiple days. In these cases a student may or may not receive extra time depending on the nature and duration of the exam. Instructors/faculty should contact the DRS Coordinator to determine if extra time is appropriate for related exams.

## Student Responsibilities

  * Activate accommodation by checking the appropriate box in student myDRS profile per the services timeline OR as soon as possible once approved by the DRS Coordinator.
  * Within one week of activating accommodations, meet with course instructors (or TA or staff member who is designated as the accommodations contact) to discuss how accommodations will be implemented, and if exams will be administered with accommodations in the department or in the DRS Testing Center.
  * Become familiar with the Guidelines for Effectively Requesting Accommodation for Alternative Testing:
    * Review DRS Testing Center Rules
    * Schedule any exams, including makeup exams, per services timelines and Testing Center guidelines
    * Modify/cancel exam requests as needed
  * Discuss any concerns regarding this accommodation with assigned DRS Coordinator.

## DRS Responsibilities

  * Provide students with their approved testing accommodations when the exam is taken in the DRS Testing Center and consult with Instructional Personnel when implemented in an academic department. 
  * Reserve a seat for students who schedule their exams in advance.
  * Keep the seat reserved for the student for 15 minutes after the scheduled start time if the student does not arrive on time; this is totally dependent on availability of space and DRS staff. 

## Faculty Responsibilities

  * Decide if they would like to provide those accommodations themselves/departmentally or if they would like for the student to test in the DRS Testing Center/rooms.
  * If they would like to utilize the DRS Center, the faculty must complete and submit the Alternative Testing Agreement (Addendum).
  * If using DRS Testing Center must upload exams to secure DRS website at least 24 hours in advance (email reminders will be sent) or deliver a hard copy of the exam to the DRS office at least 24 hours in advance. Delays may impact ability to administer exam within agreement times. 
  * Provide students with their approved testing accommodations when the exam is taken with them.

## DRS Testing Center Rules

### Students who test in the DRS Testing Center/rooms agree to:

  * Follow all University and DRS policies/procedures; Student Conduct Code: Chapter 478-121 WAC
  * Conduct themselves professionally and treat all staff members and other students with respect.
  * Request testing accommodations through myDRS for each class.
  * Meet with the professor to discuss details of the testing accommodations within one week of sending the Faculty Notification Letter.
  * Schedule their exams for times approved of by each professor.

### Before the exam, students agree to:

  * Arrive on time for scheduled exams.
  * Leave all personal items (backpacks, coats, hats, purses, cellular phones, etc.) outside the testing room.
  * Take only those materials authorized by the professor into the testing room.
  * Ask about using a timer or personal clock to help keep track of time during the exam.
  * Bring all allowed materials (calculator, scantron, pencils, etc.) needed to take the exam.

### When taking exams, students agree to:

  * Monitor their time and turn in their exams to the testing center desk before calculated time has expired. DRS will notify professors if a student use more than their allotted time.
  * Check their exams and notify testing staff immediately if there is a problem with the exam (missing pages, wrong test, etc).
  * Notify the DRS Testing Center staff when they need to leave the testing center for the restroom. Students are to place their exams and coversheets on the testing center desk.
  * Not cheat. Students will be held accountable to the University’s Code of Conduct.
  * Return any borrowed equipment to the testing center desk upon the completion of the exam (calculators, clocks, headphones, mp3 players).

### Arriving late to an exam:

  * Students arriving more than 15 minutes late to an exam may not be able to take the exam during that time at the DRS Testing Center/rooms; whether or not the student is able to take the exam will depend on DRS space and staff availability once the student arrives. 
  * Also, the student will not be allowed additional time added to their approved test timing limits in order to compensate for their tardiness.
  * DRS will consult the Testing Agreement and/or contact the professor to proceed according to the professor’s instructions.

# **Introduction**

Alternative Testing is a group of academic accommodations approved by
Disability Resources for Students (DRS) to provide access to course
examinations, tests, and quizzes for students whose documented disability
affects their ability to take exams.

Alternative testing accommodations can be facilitated by the faculty member,
academic department, or through the DRS Testing Center and or Proctoring
Service. Students should discuss their preferred testing location with their
professors; however, faculty make the final decisions about whether an exam
will be accommodated in the department or in DRS during business hours.

# **DRS Testing Services Options**

As a faculty member, you have two options in administering approved testing
accommodations:

## Option 1

**Arrange for testing accommodations in your department/classroom.**  
Please consider this option especially if:

  * The class does not meet during the DRS Testing Center hours (Mon-Fri 8:30am-5pm), or you are unwilling to have a student take the test at an alternate time
  * You and your student would like to be able to easily communicate about questions and clarifications during the test
  * The exam has specific administering or technology components that will DRS will not be able to effectively facilitate outside of the department. Examples may include the need for tech support for computer or internet based exam systems, specific software needed to use/complete/or be tested on that is not able to be installed or supported in DRS Testing Center.

If you have any questions about how to adequately accommodate your students
for in-department testing, DRS is always happy to consult and be a resource.



## Option 2

**Arrange for the exam to be administered in the DRS Testing Center.**  
A student may take some or all of their exams/quizzes in the Testing Center.
DRS will need to partner with you to ensure it can effectively administer your
exam if it contains one or more of these components or formats:

  * Audio and/or Video Components
  * Digital Images and/or interactive Powerpoint
  * Computer Based or Online Exams
  * Student using own computer for exam
  * Specific software for exams

Please contact the DRS Testing Center for assistance in determining if
administering exams with these components is better in your department.

# How to administer your own accommodated exams

It is ideal for a DRS student to be able to take an exam within an academic
department so the student has access to the course and its faculty/TA similar
to all other students in the class. The DRS Testing Center can assist faculty
in the administering of accommodated exams and can provide consultation to
support the appropriate provision of approved student accommodations. To
provide testing accommodations in the department:

  * Understand your students accommodations as listed on the Faculty Notification letter uploaded to myDRS Faculty Portal
  * Review the descriptions of 3 Most Common Testing Accommodations
  * Know if you or your department can provide any required alternative testing space (reduced distraction or private room)
  * Consult with DRS Testing Center staff on any questions you may have on the accommodations logistics

## Proctoring Services Overview

To support departments and course instructors in facilitating alternative
testing accommodations, DRS is offering Proctoring Assistance for accommodated
exams/quizzes.  If you would like to administer accommodated exams within your
department but need additional support of a proctor to ensure accommodations
occur, please contact the DRS Testing Center.

### DRS Role:

  * Provide a space analysis to determine what department available spaces would suit accommodation needs
  * Provide distraction reducing equipment if needed. May include: noise canceling headphones, cardboard dividers, earplugs
  * If needed, recruit, on board, and train proctors to aid in the administering of accommodated exams
  * Connect proctor to designated departmental contact

### Department’s Role:

  * Identify space in department for exam and partner with DRS on completing the Testing Partnership Agreement (below)
  * Review the descriptions of 3 Most Common Testing Accommodations
  * Provide proctor with any necessary orientations to the program or process
  * Provide any necessary day-of instructions to proctor
  * Maintain communication with DRS regarding any difficulties or complications with accommodated exam administration
  * Communicate exam dates and locations to DRS students

# **How to set up exams in the DRS Testing Center**

If you are unable to provide testing accommodations to students in the
department, the following information reviews how to facilitate accommodations
in the DRS Testing Center

**Complete the DRS Testing Agreement (view able in Notification letter and
myDRSFaculty Portal)  
**

The student will not be able to schedule exams with the Testing Center until
the Testing Agreement has been submitted.

When one of your students requests disability accommodations, you will be
emailed a Faculty Notification Letter from DRS. If the student requires
testing accommodations, then the testing section of the letter will contain  a
link to the Testing Agreement.  Once you complete the Testing Agreement, it
will automatically be applied for any other students requesting testing
accommodations for your class. The link will be included in every Faculty
Notification Letter, but you need only complete the agreement once per SLN
number.

**This means that if you have a class that includes one lecture and two
different quiz sections, there will be 3 agreements**

**What To Do with Multiple Agreements for One Class?**

Once the first agreement has been submitted it will automatically applied to
any other students who request testing accommodations for your class. If you
have made special arrangements with a student that are not indicated on the
class agreement, please contact DRS to modify that student’s agreement.

**Scheduling Exams**

Students are responsible to schedule exams through their myDRS account. With
every exam request, they are required to agree that they have scheduled exams
according to the syllabus or Testing Agreement specifications. To ensure that
you are aware of when students have scheduled exams, you will be sent an
automatic notice of the date and time of each exam scheduled. DRS will still
need to approve the request. You can view all exam information in your myDRS
Faculty Portal.

**Upload Exam to myDRS or hand deliver to DRS**

  * Upload to myDRS Faculty Portal (suggested method):  2 days before the test, you will receive a reminder email that will include a link to our secure server. By clicking on the link and uploading the exam, you send it directly to DRS.
  * Professor/TA Delivery:  deliver a hard copy to DRS in Mary Gates Hall, 011 at least 24 hours ahead of time. DRS hours Mon-Fri 8:30am-5pm. 
    * DRS is no longer taking student deliveries due to concerns about exam integrity. Contact DRS Testing Center if you have questions.

Please only email exams to drstest@uw.edu if you have audio components or have
trouble uploading exams to myDRS Faculty Portal.

**Exam Returns**

DRS will always scan and email completed exams to the course instructor(s)
connected in the myDRS course details. DRS partnered with UW IT to set up a
secure workflow to store and email exams electronically per our records
retention cycle and get exams to faculty faster. You are welcome to file,
store or erase them as per your process for tracking and keeping records of
exams. You may also select one of the following additional return methods if
you wish:

  * Prof/TA pick up:  DRS will hold the completed exam for you to pick up.
  * Campus Mail: DRS will send the completed exam to you via UW Campus Mail. Please note that UW Campus mail delivery can take 3-7 business days 
    * If you need a more expedited return option for a specific reason contact DRS Testing Center to discuss needs and options.

## What to expect from the Testing Center

**Exam Start Times**

When students schedule exams, DRS checks that the exam start time is within
the parameters of the Testing Agreement. If the student’s request does not
match the agreement, the student is contacted and asked to reschedule, or to
provide written indication from the professor that the change has been
approved.

**15-Minute Grace Policy**

Students are expected to show up at DRS and begin their test on time. DRS does
allow a 15-minute grace policy, in acknowledgement that the DRS office may be
further for a student than the normal class and may take more time to get to,
or there may be a need to attend to disability related items before starting
an exam.

After the 15-minute grace period has expired, students begin to forfeit their
test time just as if they were to arrive to an in-class test late. If a
student arrives after the class has begun the exam, DRS may contact the
professor for approval to administer the exam before doing so.

**Time-keeping During Exams**

DRS does not alert students when their testing time has expired. When students
begin a test in DRS, they are notified of their calculated end time and
reminded that it is their responsibility to keep track of their time. DRS does
offer personal timers and clocks, which students may use, if they wish, to
help with timekeeping.

    * e. 0123456 Smith, Claire Documentation
  * Click “Submit Documentation.”

Once your application has been processed, and assuming it contains all the
necessary information we need in order to proceed, we will contact you within
3 business days to schedule an Access Planning Meeting (APM). If additional
information is needed we will contact you regarding next steps.

### How to submit additional documentation requested by DRS prior to the APM

Additional documentation can be submitted by scanning and emailing to
uwdrs@uw.edu or mailing a hard copy to University of Washington, Disability
Resources for Students, Box 352808, Seattle, WA 98195-2808, or fax
206.616.8379 or delivering it in person to Mary Gates Hall, room 011.

## After the Access Planning Meeting (APM)

### Receiving the Student Eligibility Letter

You will receive the Student Eligibility Letter (SEL) outlining the
accommodations that were approved during the APM. You can view a copy of this
letter in your myDRS account. If you will be participating in fieldwork,
clinicals, internships, or study abroad trips, the standard Faculty
Notification Letter does not apply. You will need to schedule a separate
appointment with your DRS Coordinator to discuss accommodations appropriate to
that setting. You should initiate this discussion before your program assigns
you a placement.

### Logging in

  * Go to disability.uw.edu and click on the **YELLOW** box that says “myDRS”.
  * Log in with your UW NetID and password.
  * You will be asked to review and sign the students “Rights and Responsibilities”.
  * In addition to the “Rights and Responsibilities”, there may be other agreements that will need your review and acceptance.

### How to Request Accommodations and Send Faculty Notification Letters (FNL)
to Instructors

  * Once you have registered for classes through myUW, please allow 2 business days for your class schedule to appear on your myDRS profile.
  * After logging into myDRS, select “My Dashboard” from your myDRS home screen, located on the left-hand side.
  * Check the box(s) of the classes you would like to request services.
  * Click the button “Step 2- Continue to Customize Your Accommodations”
  * Select which accommodations you would like to request for each class. 
    * You do **not** have to select all of your accommodations.
  * Click the button “Submit your Requests”.
  * A Faculty Notification Letter (FNL) will be sent via email. The timing of when it is sent may vary. Letters requested prior to the beginning of the quarter will be sent out 5 to 7 business days before the start of the quarter. Letters sent out after the start of the quarter will typically be sent within one business day. Once your letter has been sent to your professor, you will receive a copy.
  * Contact your professor(s) to discuss how your accommodations will be implemented in each class.
  * A PDF version of your FNL will be available to print after your letter has been sent to your professor. You can choose to deliver it to your faculty directly if needed. A copy of this letter can also be found in your myDRS Mailbox.
  * Any changes to your course schedule will take 24 to 48 hours to appear on your myDRS profile.

_Somerequests will require completion of additional steps. You can find links
to these specific topics on your myDRS Dashboard after your accommodation
requests have been submitted. You will be reminded of this via a message on
your home screen.  
_

### Modifying or Cancelling a Completed Request to Send FNL

  * After logging into myDRS, select “My Dashboard” (located on the left-hand side of the myDRS home screen).
  * Scroll down to select the class(es) for which you would like to modify or cancel your accommodation request(s).

      * Click “Modify”
      * Select or deselect the accommodation(s) you need to modify
      * Click “Update Request”

## Glossary

### Access Planning Meeting

The Access Planning Meeting is for the purpose of you to be able to discuss
with a DRS Coordinator appropriate accommodations/services that can be
implemented to create equal access for you in the areas where there are or may
be anticipated barriers.

### Accommodations

Accommodations are academic adjustment or services designed to give students
with disabilities the same opportunity to succeed or fail and those without a
disability.

### Student Eligibility Letter

The Student Eligibility Letter is an email from your DRS Coordinator notifying
you of your approved accommodations. This Student Eligibility Letter (SEL)
will also confirm the next steps that you should take to request
accommodations for your classes. If your accommodations ever change, you will
receive an updated SEL.

### Faculty Notification Letter

The Faculty Notification Letter (FNL) is an email requested by the student
through myDRS, for each class. It notifies each faculty member which
accommodations you have selected for their specific course.

# Complaint Resolution Resources

The University of Washington is committed to providing equality of opportunity
and an  
environment that fosters respect for all members of the University community.

lf you are having difficulty with a person, office, or department at the
University of Washington  
and believe you have or may be experiencing mistreatment or discrimination on
the basis of your disability, you can contact the resources listed below for
assistance.

For more information about the process and your rights as a student, please
review the  
university documents _Executive Order No. 31: Non-discrimination and
Affirmative Action_ and  
_Resolution of Complaints Against University Employees_.

### Steps to take if you have a conflict:

  * Try to resolve issue with faculty and/or staff directly
  * Contact DRS for assistance in resolving issues related to accommodations
  * Engage UW campus/off-campus resources if initial avenues do not resolve  
the concern/complaint

#### **Some strategies to help you get your concerns addressed:**

  * When making a complaint, be specific. lt can be helpful to document the  
incident(s), and the action(s) taken, including dates, times, names and a
statement  
explaining the interactions. State what individual(s)/office(s) you believe
has  
discriminated against you, when the incident occurred, and describe the
incident.

  * lf you are attempting to resolve a problem that includes a number of offices,  
it may help to let each office know what other efforts you have made to try to  
resolve the complaint.

  * Keep a record of all written correspondence between yourself and the various  
offices you work with.

## UW Campus Resources

**DISABILITY RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS (DRS)** is available to assist students in
solving problems related to the provision of academic accommodations. DRS
staff are often able to assist in resolving complaints quickly, as UW faculty
and/or staff are not always aware of the rights of students with disabilities.
DRS can also appropriately refer students to other offices or individuals who
can assist with resolution. Students can contact their DRS Coordinator or the
DRS office directly if they have questions.

**THE ADA COORDINATOR**  can provide information and assistance to individuals
who wish to raise a complaint or have concerns or questions regarding
ADA/Section 504 guidance. Additionally, DRS may consult directly with the ADA
Coordinator as needed on areas of UW policy and process. Students may contact
the UW ADA Coordinator at 206-543-9717 (voice and relay) or  adaoffce@uw.edu
(e-mail). More information on the website: https://www.washington.edu/ada/

**THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUD** provides resources and facilitation for
preventing, managing, and resolving conflict at the university. Students may
drop by the office at HUB 339 during normal business hours, or contact the
staff at 206-543-6028 (voice), ombuds@uw.edu (email), or visit their website
at https://uw.edu/ombud.

**CIVIL RIGHTS INVESTIGATION OFFICE**  is the place to request a formal
University investigation and resolution of complaints regarding
nondiscrimination and/or non-retaliation policies. Call 206-616-2028 (voice)
to discuss your complaint with a **Civil Rights Investigation Office** staff
member. Students may be asked to leave a message, but will get a return phone
call from a staff member. You can also contact the office at cr-
investigations@uw.edu (email), or visit their website at
https://www.washington.edu/cr-investigations.

## Off-Campus Resources

**THE WASHINGTON STATE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION (WSHRC)** is the state agency
responsible for administering the Washington Law Against Discrimination (RCW
49.60); they serve as a neutral, fact-finding agency to investigate and
resolve complaints of discriminatory practices. You can contact the WSHRC at
800-233-3247 (toll-free voice), 206-464-6500 (voice) or 206-587-5168 (TTY).
For more information, visit their website at: http://hum.wa.gov.

**THE OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS (OCR)** in the U.S. Department of Education is
the enforcement agency far Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and
the Americans with Disabilities Act. OCR will examine the factors of the
alleged discrimination and interview appropriate persons to establish the
facts, determine if discrimination has taken place and resolve the complaint.
When a student is not satisfied with the on-campus efforts to resolve a
complaint, OCR is a place to turn.

You can contact the Washington State office at 206-607-1600 (voice) or
800-877-8339 (TTY), or OCR.Seattle@ed.gov (email). For more information about
the ED OCR, go to their website: https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/ .

Welcome

##

Welcome to the Institute on Human Development and Disability (IHDD), where we
strive to promote a world that values and supports full participation of
individuals with disabilities in all aspects of life.

## Director’s Message

It is my pleasure to welcome you to the University of Washington Institute on
Human Development and Disability (UW IHDD). Founded in 1963, the UW IHDD is
one of the few centers in the United States composed of three major federally
funded core programs, a Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental
Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC), a University Center for Excellence in
Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD), and the Leadership Education in
Neurodevelopmental and Related Disabilities (LEND), combined in one
comprehensive center.

# Alliance for Disability Law and Justice (ADLJ)

### The Alliance for Disability Law and Justice (ADLJ) at UW Law advocates for
a more inclusive, accessible, and holistic approach to law school from a
foundation of anti-racism, intersectionality, and anti-ableism. ADLJ is guided
by a vision of a legal profession that centers and celebrates the perspectives
of all people, particularly those that have been marginalized by the legal
system. As an intersectional feminist organization, ADLJ is committed to
fighting ableism and oppression in our community, advocating for positive
change and accessibility, and collaborating throughout the process.

### The mission of the Alliance is to create a UW Law community that
acknowledges barriers to authentic inclusion, removes them as they arise and
guarantees accessibility and inclusion for everyone.

# ASUW Student Disability Commission

### Student Disability Commission is housed in the Associated Students of the
University of Washington (ASUW), the Student Disability Commission is a
student run and led advocacy organization committed to serving students, staff
and faculty with disabilities at UW. The SDC understands disability as not
merely an individual or medical problem, but rather the result of attitudinal
and physical barriers preventing full participation in society.
